<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I would like to present to you a program for viewing, comparing, creating and extracting files from BAR archives of the Age of Empires 3: Definitive Edition (also supports AoE3 Legacy). With this application, you can easily view and extract any content of the game. Tool replaces the AoE3Ed Viewer developed by Ykkrosh, which does not work for the Definitive Edition.
The updated version includes all functions that were in AoE3Ed Viewer, as well as new features:

**Preview:**
* Syntax highlighting in previewing text files (xml, xs).
* Search in preview in text files (CTRL + F).
* Ability to scale and drag images in preview.

**Entries table:**
* Grouping files by their format (optional).
* Sort by name, size, creation date.
* Search in the BAR archive.
* BAR caching and versioning.
* Calculation of Hash.
* The size of the selected entries.
* Detail of entry file.
* Copy path of entry to clipboard.

**Conversion:**
* Converting XML <-> JSON <-> XMB (both Legacy and DE).
* Converting DDT -> PNG.
* Converting DDT <-> TGA.

**Extract:**
* Extract all files.
* Extract selected files.
* Extract files to one folder.
* Extract from list of paths.
* Entries details as JSON.
* Extract PNG with compression.
* Extract PNG as WEBP.

**Other:**
* Comparison of BAR archives.
* Create BAR archive from files and folders.
